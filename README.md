# ESL-app-research

## Overview
Over the course of 5 months, I conducted 40 interviews and prototyped 6-7 different designs for an app to teach intermediate to advanced ESL (English as a Second Language). These are things that might interest you:

My target user was adult learners. I ended up testing around 6-7 different prototypes across 40 interviews, primarily with speakers of Brazilian Portuguese and Thai, but also Spanish, Russian and other assorted languages. Interviews were conducted in English and sometimes Thai.

Language acquisition is hard. The vast majority of apps out there felt trivial to these users and I wanted to investigate what higher level language apps might look like. 

## Process
I developed prototypes using Figma and Adobe XD, allowing myself no longer than 3 weeks for a given prototype (often times using just 1 week). I initially was very ambitious and wanted to have something to test with a user _every week_. This pace didn't last longer than a few weeks, but the spirit of rapid iteration and user testing was a strong theme for this project. 

### A change in philosophy
My earlier programming projects in Java and Rust were complicated and not market-oriented. In other words they were personal projects that deeply intersted me and were not meant for commercial applications. 

At the beginning of this project, on the suggestion of friends, I read and was heavily influenced by two books: (1) Inspired (2) and Design Sprint. The biggest take-away fromt hese projects aws this: good product discovery comes from constant iteration with consistent testing with real users. <quote from inspired> 
  
While my overall philosophy was more inspired by Inspired, I also greatly enjoyed applying the workflow proposed in Sprint. This book basically introduced the concept of a design sprint, and while designed for teams, I found it extremely helpful in these ways: 
  - Emphasis on asking the big questions up front: what are biggest risks, why will this fail
  - Alternation of ideation / brainstorming and committing to certain ideas but only after a lot of exploration. 
  - This was huge: building a prototype in **one day**. 
  As an avowed masochistic perfectionist, this last point was extremely enlightening for me. It really made me aware of how a working prototype can be made without much time at all, and that a lot of time spent building projects can be wasted by taking too long to implement a not-so-well-thought out idea and not isolating the biggest hypothesis/risk first.

  For some of the prototypes I strictly followed the design sprint protocol: using day 1 to brainstorm big ideas and do research, Tuesday to ideate and brainstorm, Wednesday to make final committment and design choices, Thursday to build the prototype, then Friday to do user tests. 
  
 ### Interviews
  The question I started most interviews with was this: "What is hardest about learning English?" I tried not to lead the answer in any way, but found consistent answers across native languages: tenses, pronunciation, and phrasal verbs. 
 
  ## Design
  My initial designs were heavily influenced by Brilliant.org, a website that teaches advanced math concepts in a surprisingly well gamified way. I really liked how they could make a complex concept feel like a puzzle or challenge. While I knew that language learning was of course fundamentally different than math, I still liked the idea of a app that endeavored to go beyond the basics and rigorously challenge students. 
  
  My early designs were near identical copies of Brilliant layouts.

As time went on, I made questions shorter and shorter, focused increasingly on topics such as grammar and pronunciation that got the best feedback from students. I also was still interested in the idea of having lessons followed by quizzes, but the lessons themselves were often uninteresting to users, so I continually shortened and streamlined them, eventually mimicking an app called Lucid to try animated explanations:
  
  ## Lessons Learned
  - You don't know what the user wants. They don't know what they want. So you need to test with users ASAP.
  - Ask people non-leading questions. Get them to talk about what's difficult. Get them to talk about their feelings. 
  - Don't waste people's time. If testers are doing this for free, end with extra time, be incredibly thankful, kep interviews short. 
  - Look at competitors early on. Watch users use competitors. It's easy to look down at what other people are doing in a problem space, but if they're making money and you're not, well then they must be doing something right...

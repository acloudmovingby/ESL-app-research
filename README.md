# ESL-app-research

## Overview
Over the course of around 5 months, I researched and prototyped designs for an app to teach intermediate to advanced ESL (English as a Second Language). My target user was adult learners. I ended up testing around 6-7 different prototypes across 40 interviews, primarily with speakers of Brazilian Portuguese and Thai, but also Spanish, Russian and other assorted languages. Interviews were conducted in English and sometimes Thai. 

Language acquisition is hard. The vast majority of apps out there felt trivial to these users and I wanted to investigate what higher level language apps might look like.

## Process
I developed prototypes using Figma and Adobe XD, allowing myself no longer than 3 weeks for a given prototype (often times using just 1 week). I initially was very ambitious and wanted to have something to test with a user _every week_. This pace didn't last longer than a few weeks, but the spirit of rapid iteration and user testing was a strong theme for this project. 

### A change in philosophy
My earlier programming projects in Java and Rust were complicated and not market-oriented. In other words they were personal projects that deeply intersted me and were not meant for commercial applications. 

At the beginning of this project, on the suggestion of friends, I read and was heavily influenced by two books: (1) Inspired (2) and Design Sprint. The biggest take-away fromt hese projects aws this: good product discovery comes from constant iteration with consistent testing with real users. <quote from inspired> 
  
While my overall philosophy was more inspired by Inspired, I also greatly enjoyed applying the workflow proposed in Sprint. This book basically introduced the concept of a design sprint, and while designed for teams, I found it extremely helpful in these ways: 
  - Emphasis on asking the big questions up front: what are biggest risks, why will this fail
  - Alternation of ideation / brainstorming and committing to certain ideas but only after a lot of exploration. 
  - This was huge: building a prototype in **one day**. 
  As an avowed masochistic perfectionist, this last point was extremely enlightening for me. It really made me aware of how a working prototype can be made without much time at all, and that a lot of time spent building projects can be wasted by taking too long to implement a not-so-well-thouhgt out idea and not isolating the biggest hypothesis/risk first.

  For some of the prototypes I strictly followed the design sprint protocol: using day 1 to brainstorm big ideas and do research, Tuesday to ideate and brainstorm, Wednesday to make final committment and design choices, Thursday to build the prototype, then Friday to do user tests.
